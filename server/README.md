# WebRTC client

A very simple WebRTC signalling server in NodeJS. It accepts WebSocket connections from [clients](../client/) and broadcasts their availability to other clients. When two clients are available, they establish a direct P2P WebRTC connection to exchange video streams.

## üèÉ How to run

To run the server, you can follow the steps below:

- `cd server`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`. This will start the WebSocketServer on ws://localhost:8090. It will also start an HTTP server on port 4000, but that's not relevant for this demo.
- Start the [clients](../client/)
